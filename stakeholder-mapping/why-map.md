# Stakeholder mapping process

This file documents the development of stakeholder mapping for the TRIC-DT.

## What are we trying to achieve?

We'd like to know who we can connect with for engagement or dissemination to advance the mission of the TRIC-DT Hub.

We'd like to find people and groups who are receptive to our practices and can support the growth in reach, diversity, capacity and influence of the community. Importantly, we also need to identify people of groups who can and should contribute to the strategicl direction setting of the community itself.

We need to understand the priorities of our community, what they care about and what infrastructure we can develop to support and facilitate their success.

To do this, we need to know who the community are and what messaging and processes we should use to engage with them. 

A lot of community work is finding people. Our stakeholder list is individuals to approach directly ("people"), and where we can find more people to connect with ("companies"). Note engagement is most effective when individuals are approached directly and the ask is tailored to their priorities. Connecting with groups and organisations is important for disemination, conviening, and as a route to first contact with our community. 

## Who are our stakeholders?

Broad categorisations of the career stage and professional organisational units of our stakeholders can help identify common needs, priorities and communications strategies to reach them most effectively. 

The meaningful organisational units and descriptors developed and applied here were based on early identified stakeholders (n = 92). This list was complied from the sharepoint RAM people list and the RCMs (unplublised) list.

## Why and how should we engage with each stakeholder?

Unerstanding the influence, interest and engagement of a stakeholder can helps us to prioritise, develop and manage our communications and engagement activities. Effective engagement with these stakeholders will support our objectives of the TRIC-DT, systematically and  efficieny.

We have developed the following decriptives and measures of infulence and engagement based on the [combined RCM and RAM stakeholder mapping templates](https://malvikasharan.github.io/community-building-foundational-training/cop-basic.html). Applying these broad categories can help us to identify risks and opportunities for engagement, and develope appropriate communications infrastructure. 

*Note: Potential to be impacted by the programme (high, medium, low) is not currently included in the map data collection.*

### Level of influence over the programme
- "influence-low" = has little impact on the decision making or success of the programme
- "influence-medium" = has some impact on the decision making or success of the programme
- "influence-high" = has high impact on the decision making or success of the programme

### Interest in the programme
- "interest-low" = there is awareness (we know them, or we assume they know of us), but no specific attempts to engage, or attemtps have been unsuccessful
- "interest-medium" = they have engaged, but are not reaching out for opportunities
- "interest-high" = they have repreatedly engaged and directed opportunities to engage

### How to engage
- "keep informed" = diseminate updates at an appropriate level (e.g. Programme updates for Turing teams, or community updates for community members)
- "keep satisfied" = Individuals with high influence but low interest
- "manage closely" = Individuals with high influence and high interest
- "monitor" = follow their activities to anticipate needs of the community

### Mountain of Engagement level
- "01-Discovery" = we discover them
- "02-First contact" = first engagement, e.g. request to join the mailing list, register for an event, join a community call. No activie participation or contribution to discussion or materials
- "03-Participation" = active participation or contribution, e.g. commenting on slack, asking a question in a community call
- "04-Sustained participation" = regularly participating (now or recently) as described above
- "05-Networked participation" = connecting with others in the community (evidence of building a network), or bringing others into the community
- "06-Leadership" = taking on some responsibility in the community, e.g. organising a seminar or joining a working group


## Why are we doing this?

Professionalised and equitable engagement processes and routes to impact are part of the unique offering of the programme, made possible by our well resources infrastructure team. A strategic, well managed and live stakeholder map will support the success of the programme by facilitating engagement through best use of our expertise and resources. 

We are documenting this process along the way to best capture detail and provide space for structured development and asynchronous contibution.
