# Research Application Management

### What is Research Application Management?
The role of a [Research Application Manager (RAM)](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html?highlight=research%20application%20manager) was pioneered at the Turing Institute to bridge the gap between academic knowledge generation and practical tool creation. This role is essential in translating theoretical research into usable, practical applications. At TRIC-DT, [Kalle Westerling](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kalle-westerling) and [Sophie Arana](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/dr-sophie-arana) serve as the Research Application Managers, bringing their expertise to the forefront of digital twin technology and research.

### Why are RAMs Relevant for TRIC-DT?
The role of a Research Application Manager is particularly relevant for TRIC-DT to promote interoperability and generalisability of new and existing outputs/software. The TRIC-DT spans three research themes, so an important aim is to scaffold a multi-disciplinary community of practice, that can jointly address common challenges in the trustworthy and responsible development of digital twins, such as reproducibility and interoperability. 

The Research Application Managers play a vital role in ensuring these objectives are met, facilitating the integration and application of diverse research outputs across multiple disciplines. This work is also crucial for our broader aspiration to move towards a system of systems or [ecosystems of digital twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/towards-ecosystems-connected-digital-twins-address-global-challenges).

### What Do RAMs Do for TRIC-DT?

- **End-to-End Stakeholder Engagement:** We actively engage with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring that the research outputs are co-created to meet the needs of various users. To connect to external user communities, RAMs represent TRIC-DT at community events such as the [Connected Places Catapult DT Hubs Gemini calls](https://digitaltwinhub.co.uk/media/feature-focus/synergistic-twinning-bridging-health-infrastructure-and-environment-sophie-arana-the-alan-turing-institute-r179/). 

- **Delivering Project Strategy:** We assist in developing and executing project strategies. For instance, RAMs support researchers in the creation of the [autoemulate](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/185/views/1) package, showcasing our commitment to hands-on project management and strategic guidance.

- **Co-Creating Documentation and Guidance:** We are dedicated to co-creating documentation and guidance around research outputs. This approach not only ensures the sustainability of our research but also extends their reach and impact, making them more accessible to a broader audience. RAMs will work closely with the TRIC-DT researchers to find best routes to impact for their research output.

In summary, the role of the Research Application Managers at TRIC-DT is multifaceted, encompassing stakeholder engagement, project strategy, and the promotion of usability and interoperability in digital twin ecosystems. The goal is to bridge the gap between research and practical application, ensuring that TRIC-DT's outputs are impactful, sustainable, and widely accessible.
