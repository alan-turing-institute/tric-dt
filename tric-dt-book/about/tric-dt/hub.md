# The TRIC-DT Innovation and Impact Hub

The Innovation and Impact Hub (TRIC-DT Hub) will help coordinate and convene the scientific aims and objectives of the [three TRIC-DT themes](themes.md), by supporting the development of open and reproducible tools, driving impact with diverse stakeholders, building and supporting multi-disciplinary communities of practice, and embedding best practices for responsible research and innovation throughout the TRIC-DT.

This work will be undertaken alongside focussed understanding and evaluation of needs and challenges faced by the TRIC-DT communities (e.g. internal and external stakeholder engagement, participatory design workshops for research infrastructure).
Leveraging the expertise of dedicated research community managers and research application managers, the TRIC-DT Hub will also ensure that the scientific vision of the three themes is aligned with the challenge-led focus of Turing 2.0 ambitions for science and innovation by leveraging existing tools and practices from across the Turing and its network (e.g. open and reproducible guidance on best practices from TPS programme).

The Hub team will work with the TRIC-DT to develop robust and reliable indicators to measure progress against the Hubâ€™s own aims and the wider impact of the TRIC-DT research.
For instance, indicators that demonstrate effective validation and impact of open and community-driven research infrastructure.[^research-infrastructure]
