# The TRIC-DT Innovation and Impact Hub

The TRIC-DT Innovation and Impact Hub (hereafter, the Hub) supports the delivery of two key outputs of the TRIC-DT

Produce open and reproducible computational tools for DT design, development, and deployment that facilitate scaling of DTs and provide these tools as a freely available resource.
Build a multidisciplinary community of practice in digital twinning that democratises access to DT technology.
The Hub team leads and co-develop usable resources that facilitate collaborative impact and innovation that is trustworthy and responsible (e.g. knowledge commons, case studies, skills and capabilities building. This work is undertaken alongside focused understanding and evaluation of needs and challenges faced by the TRIC-DT community (e.g. internal and external stakeholder engagement, participatory design workshops for research infrastructure).
