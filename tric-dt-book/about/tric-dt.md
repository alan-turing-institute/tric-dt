# About the TRIC-DT

Digital twin technology is accelerating our understanding and prediction of complex systems in the natural environment, infrastructure, health, and other areas.

The Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT) is working across these three domains and also considering how ecosystems of interconnected digital twins can be developed.
There are multiple inter-related research and innovation challenges involved in this activity.
These include developing innovative methods and algorithms for use in digital twins.
In addition, questions relating to interoperability between digital twins, are key to creating ecosystems, and there are wider topics such as standardisation in methods used to collect, transfer and analyse real world data from physical twins, and integration with computational models to predict, control or analyse that system.  

The TRIC-DT team are working in collaboration with a range of partners, and are aligned with delivery of the new Turing 2.0 and the Grand Challenge strategies.

This TRIC-DT mission will be realised by working closely with key development partners to deliver three interlinked objectives:

- Advance the science and implementation of digital twinning and use these advances to address important technological and societal challenges.
- Produce open and reproducible computational tools for digital twin design, development, and deployment that facilitate scaling of digital twins and provide these tools as a freely available resource.  
- Build a multidisciplinary community of practice in digital twinning that democratises access to digital twin technology.
