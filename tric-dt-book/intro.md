# Welcome to the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins

![Illustration of a city's digital twin. The top half depicts a stylized cityscape with buildings, a bridge, wind turbines, and a few clouds in the sky, suggesting a blend of urban development and renewable energy. Below, a mirrored version of the cityscape is shown in a digital format, with circuit-like patterns and abstract data representations. The transition between the real and digital is seamless, highlighting the concept of a digital twin as a virtual model of a city's infrastructure and systems.](assets/images/hero-image.png)
