# 'Crafting Digital Twins' Seminar Series

The ‚ÄúCrafting Digital Twins: Computational Methods Across Environment, Health & Infrastructure‚Äù seminar series will be an interdisciplinary platform for TRIC-DT researchers to share and discuss the computational methods, algorithms, and models that underpin Digital Twin technology across diverse fields. 

This series will provide a space for exchange of knowledge and methodologies across the themes of natural environment, health, and infrastructure. The aim is to cultivate a unified vocabulary and find synergies in our work across the TRIC-DT community.

By focusing on shared methods this series will offer immediate value to researchers and developers, enabling everyone to get practical insights applicable to their project at any stage, no matter how ‚ÄúDT-ready‚Äù. Beyond the technical learnings, presenting to a broader peer group allows us to see common challenges from fresh perspectives, igniting innovative solutions to common problems.

Each Seminar will follow roughly this format:
- Total duration of 1 hour
- 10 minutes of welcome & updates
- 2 x 15 minute talks (from different themes)
- 15 min open discussion space, to explore the presentation topics

We collect definitions and helpful explanations for domain-specific terms in our [TRIC-DT Glossary](https://hackmd.io/npUXO9llSDqagVM3SntR_w)

Seminars will be hosted by [Sophie Arana](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/dr-sophie-arana) & , please email us with any questions!

## What should the seminars cover?
We‚Äôve opened an issue in this repository for each topic we‚Äôre considering. We'd like your input and "votes" on these, and your suggestions for other topics we haven't listed! We'd like for this series to be lead by your needs, interests and activities as researchers in these fields, so we can make a space to progress *your* priorities. We invite you to shape this seminar series into a valuable space for the TRIC-DT research community.

- Add comment on an existing [topic suggestion issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22seminar+series%22): propose speakers, resources, how would this topic fit into your work?
- Show your interest in a [topic suggestion issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22seminar+series%22) with a üëçüèºüéâüöÄüëéüèºüòï
- Suggest a new topic by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues/new?assignees=&labels=0%2F+idea&projects=&template=topic-suggestion-for-tric-dt-event.md&title=%5BTopic%5D)

Current topic suggestions:
- [ ] Relational Databases
- [ ] Generative Models for DT
- [ ] Uncertainty Quantification
- [ ] Dynamic Knowledge Graphs (scheduled)
- [ ] Gemini Principles

## Sign-up as a presenter
For existing topics, sign up as a presenter by **assigning yourself** to an [issue with label `seminar series`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22seminar+series%22) and then **commenting with a title** and a few sentences describing your presentations. We will assign a date to each session, once we have a clear idea of presenters. We're looking for folks from different research areas to present on the same topic, so feel free to make suggestions!

We will label issues with `0/idea`, `1/in planning`, `2/scheduled` and `3/completed`, so you know which are currently open for contribution.
