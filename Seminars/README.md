# 'Crafting Digital Twins' Seminar Series

The “Crafting Digital Twins: Computational Methods Across Environment, Health & Infrastructure” seminar series will be an interdisciplinary platform for TRIC-DT researchers to share and discuss about the computational methods, algorithms, and models that underpin Digital Twin technology in diverse fields. This series will provide a space for exchange of knowledge and methodologies across the themes of environment, health, and infrastructure, with the aim to cultivate a unified vocabulary and uncover synergies in our work across TRIC-DT.

By focusing on the methodological hurdles of the foundational work, this series will offer immediate value to researchers and developers, enabling everyone to acquire practical insights applicable to their project at any stage, no matter how “DT-ready”. Beyond the technical learnings, presenting to a broader peer group allows us to see common challenges from fresh perspectives, potentially igniting innovative solutions to common problems.

Each Seminar will follow roughly this format:
- Total of 1,5 hour duration
- 10 minutes of welcome & TRIC-DT announcements
- 2 x 15 - 20 minute talks (from different themes)
- Plenty of room for Q&A and discussions

## Next events
We are currently finding dates for first seminars in November & December. If you haven't received an email about this, please email sarana@turing.ac.uk for the doodle link

## Sign-up as a presenter
For existing topics, sign up as a presenter by **assigning yourself to an issue** with label `seminar series` and then **commenting with a title** and a few sentences describing your presentations. We will assign a date to each session, once we have researchers from at least two different themes signed up.

We will label issues with `0/idea`, `1/in planning`, `2/scheduled` and `3/completed`.

## Propose a topic
We’ve opened an issue in this repository for each topic we’re considering. We'd like your input and "votes" on these, and your suggestions for other topics we haven't thought of. We want to invite everyone to collaborate on shaping this seminar series in something that serves the TRIC-DT research community best.

- Show your interest in a topic with a 👍🏼🎉🚀👎🏼😕
- Suggest a topic by opening a new issue
- Add to an existing idea: propose speakers, resources, how would this topic fit into your work?
