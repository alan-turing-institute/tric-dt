## Joining the Community

<!-- this should be enabled after we add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file
TRIC-DT is a community-led project that values collaborative development. All members and their contributions must **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. We follow the same CoC as the Turing Way, so you can familiarize yourself with the CoC for expected behaviors and CoC reporting and enforcement mechanisms detailed in their [Community Handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc.html).
-->

## Inclusivity

TRIC-DT aims to be inclusive to individuals from all backgrounds and research fields. We encourage contributions that reflect this intention.

- use respectful, gender-neutral and inclusive language (learn more about inclusive writing on page 22 of [University of Leicester Study Skills pdf](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/oer/oers/ssds/oers/study-skills/studyskills.pdf), also available as a [zipped html](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/oer/oers/ssds/oers/study-skills/studyskills_HTML.zip)).
- aim to include perspectives of researchers from different research backgrounds such as science, humanities and social sciences by not limiting the scope to only scientific domains.
- make sure that the colour palettes are accessible to colour-blind readers and contributors. See the blogpost [Designing Scientific Figures for Colour Blindness](https://www.lewismackenzie.science/updates-1/2017/2/9/designing-scientific-figures-for-colour-blindness) for an example of how somebody improved one of their diagrams, including links to recommended colour palettes and a colour-blindness simulator. for an example of how somebody improved one of their diagrams, including links to recommended colour palettes and a colour-blindness simulator.

## Contributing through GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com) are essential tools for our collaboration. If you are new to these platforms, our team is here to help. Start by [setting up a free GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/).

## Writing in Markdown

Our documentation is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). If you're unfamiliar with Markdown, GitHub's guide on [writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) is a helpful resource.

Please [start each new sentence on a new line](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html#write-each-sentence-in-a-new-line-line-breaks) for easier review and editing.

## Where to Start: Issues

Before creating a new issue, check if it's already being discussed in our [open issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues). Use our [issue templates](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues/new/choose) to guide you.

### Making a Change with a Pull Request

We appreciate all contributions to TRIC-DT. To make a contribution:

1. **Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue** referencing your addition. This ensures that your contribution doesn't overlap with others' work.

2. **Fork the `tric-dt` repository** to your profile. This gives you a personal copy where you can experiment and make changes.

3. **Make your changes** in your fork. Commit often with clear, detailed messages. Keep your changes focused and incremental.

4. **Submit a pull request** to the main repository. Open it as early as possible to get feedback. Use "[WIP]" in the title for work in progress, and change it to "[Ready for review]" when it's complete.

5. **Review process:** Be responsive to questions and feedback from the TRIC-DT team. Update your pull request with any changes needed.

## The Process of Adding Content

- **Fork the repository** from [alan-turing-institute/tric-dt](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt) if you have not already.

- **Create a branch** for the content you're adding.

<!-- We don't have a template currently:
- **Use the chapter template** to start writing your chapter. Commit your changes regularly.
-->

- **Submit a pull request** for review, marking it as "[WIP]" until it's ready for high-level review.

- **Work collaboratively** on the content, making high-level changes such as adding material or restructuring sections.

- **Transition the pull request** to "[Ready for review]" for low-level changes like rewording or fixing typos.

- **Merge the pull request** once it's complete. Keep the branch open for potential future improvements.

## Style Guide

Refer to _The Turing Way_'s [Style Guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) for guidelines on consistency, readability, and accessibility.

We don't want this currently:
## Representing TRIC-DT

If you wish to represent TRIC-DT at events or in other forums, please use our [promotion pack](link-to-promotion-pack) and notify our team for support.

<-- Should enable this after we enable all-contributors bot?
## Recognising Contributions

All types of contributions are welcomed and recognized. We acknowledge contributions in the same way as the Turing Way, so you can see their [community handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html) for more details.

To add a contributor, use the all-contributors bot with the command:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```

Refer to the [Emoji Key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for types of contributions.

**Note:** Add one contributor at a time to avoid merge conflicts.
