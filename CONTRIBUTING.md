# Contributing to TRIC-DT repo and Knowledge Commons

Welcome to the TRIC-DT GitHub repository!

The point of this file is to make it easy for you to get involved in our activities and contribute to these materials. If you have any questions that aren't covered here please let us know via an issue, pull request, or contact us!

## Why contribute

**A key mission of TRIC-DT is to [democratise access to open, reproducible and trustworthy ecosystems of digital twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/tric-dt).**

**This is best acheived through broad and open collaboration in the materials we create and share.**

**We invite you to contribute to these materials and our activites in any way you can, to make sure your perspecties and expertise are included, supporting the development of robust, accessible and equitable outputs.**

## Why GitHub

These materials are being developed in GitHub to ensure atribution and version control. Take a look at the [Github for Collaborative Documentation](https://cassgvp.github.io/github-for-collaborative-documentation/) for a quick overview on why we recomend this processs, and [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) for a more in-depth discussion.

### Github account
Before you can contribute formally (i.e. add to these materials directly), you'll need a [GitHub account (free)](https://github.com). 

### GitHub contribution processes

You can contribute by [getting in touch with us](#contact-us) and we will record your engagement using  [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org).

You can also contribute directly to these materials GitHub processes ([issues](#issues) and [pull requests](https://cassgvp.github.io/github-for-collaborative-documentation/docs/tut/3-2-fork-their-repo.html))

## Issues
Github issues are a way of publicly recording conversations relating to decision making, and the creation of outputs. They can also be used in a project team to stage and prioritise activity and delivery of materials. See [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/os-comms/os-comms-issue-tracking.html) for an in-depth backgounrd on issues and project boards.

*Take a look at our [issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues) to see what we're working on, and our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/146/views/4) to see how we are planning delivery.*

### Commenting on issues
Issues are actionable conversations with atribution and emojis :grin:. We uses issues to record decision making, and we invite you to contribute to that process by commenting on an issue! 

**Take a look at this [issue about our README](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues/17) for an example of how we work with issues :rocket:**

### Open a new issue
If you'd like to start a conversation about something which isn't already an open issue, you'd love you to [open a new one](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues/new/choose)! 

## Pull requests (PR)
If you spot something in these materials which you want to suggest changing directly, we invite you to [submit a pull request (PR)](https://cassgvp.github.io/github-for-collaborative-documentation/docs/tut/3-2-fork-their-repo.html)! 

If it's something simple like fixing a typo (there may be typos!), you are welcome to go straight  into a pull request :blush:. 

If your suggested change is more substantial, please [open an issue](#open-a-new-issue) for discussion before getting too deep into the work, or better yet, [contact us](#contact-us)! 

A discussion before submitting a PR makes a space ensure your suggestions can be integrated with work that's currently underway, and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you plan to carry out.

## Particpate in our activities

### Stakeholder map
We are creating a map of the TRIC-DT community to understand the shape and structure of our community, in terms of expertise, engagement and opportunities. The map will inform the development of effective and systematic engagement strategies, and support members of the community in connecting with eachother. An interactive visualisation of individuals (name, email and affiliations), research projects and companies or institutions who are connected to or engaged with the TRIC-DT programme will be created and shared using kumu.

You will soon be able to [review our stakeholder map and add themselves](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues/46). Follow the [stakeholder map issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astakeholder-map) for updates on this work.

### Seminar series
Join us online for our [next seminar](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/tree/main/Seminars#attend-a-seminar) to hear about the latest foundational and applied research in digital twinning being conducted at Turing. These seminars are an excellent platform to understand the multidisciplinary challenges of Digital Twin research as each seminar brings together two speakers from distinct research domains. We encourage you to share your viewpoints and [suggest new topics](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues/new?assignees=&labels=0%2F+idea&projects=&template=topic-suggestion-for-tric-dt-event.md&title=%5BTopic%5D)!

## Code of conduct
* Placeholder - what CoC should we invoke and how do we implement it? Preference to follow a Turing wide process*

## Contact us

If you have a question or a comment we'd love to hear from you! 

Turing members can join our slack channel #digital-twins in the [Turing Slack workspace](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2166?SearchId=327870). Any and all questions/comments welcomed! We look forward to speaking with you :)

Please contact digitaltwins@turing.ac.uk for all other enquiries to be directed to an appropriate team member.

## Thank you!

Our efforts to [democratise access to open, reproducible and trustworthy ecosystems of digital twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/tric-dt) are made possible by the engagement and contributions of our community. We greatly value the time, energy and expertise you contribute to this work, and hope you will benefit from working with us. Thank you for your contribution to the development of a positive and impactful TRIC-DT community.
