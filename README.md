### What is the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins?

Since its inception in 2015, The [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjHlMuima7_AhUUoVwKHSRHD-EQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.turing.ac.uk%2F&usg=AOvVaw0uxvZzQpCGw78bVsaCsSOm) has invested more than ¬£26M in digital twin (DT) research and innovation across a wide portfolio of projects including the development of foundational theory and applications in the engineering, environmental and social sciences.
This activity represents one of the largest portfolios of academic DT research in the UK.

The Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT), builds on this foundation and has a central role in delivering the [Turing 2.0 research and innovation strategy](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/our-strategy).

### What is the Innovation and Impact Hub?

The Innovation and Impact Hub (hereafter, the Hub) was set up to support the goals and objectives of the TRIC-DT:

1. Advance the science and implementation of digital twinning and use these advances to address important technological and societal challenges.
2. Produce open and reproducible computational tools for DT design, development, and deployment that facilitate scaling of DTs and provide these tools as a freely available resource.
3. Build a multidisciplinary community of practice in digital twinning that democratises access to DT technology.

For instance, the Hub team will lead and co-develop usable resources that facilitate collaborative impact and innovation that is trustworthy and responsible (e.g. knowledge commons, case studies, skills and capabilities building.
This work will be undertaken alongside focused understanding and evaluation of needs and challenges faced by the TRIC-DT community (e.g. internal and external stakeholder engagement, participatory design workshops for research infrastructure).
