# Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT)

Welcome to the the repository for the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins.

<!-- ![An illustration of a digital twin for a city.](./assets/images/digital-twin.jpg) -->

This repository will contain the framework for the TRIC-DT [community knowledge commons](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tric-dt/issues/6), and engagement activities for the TRIC-DT community. It is managed by the TRIC-DT Hub.

We invite you to collaborate with us!

## About the TRIC-DT

The TRIC-DTs mission is to:
1. Carry out fundamental research relating to digital twins (DTs) that addresses the most urgent challenges facing society and achieves real-world impact.
2. Work in line with and contibute to the sucess of the [Turing 2.0 research and innovation strategy](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/our-strategy). 
3. Democratise access to DTs through active community management and engagement emplying the [TPS RCM guiding principles](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-research-community-management#rcm-teams-guiding-principles)

## The TRIC-DT Hub

The TRIC-DT Innovation and Impact Hub (hereafter, the Hub) supports the delivery of two key outputs of the TRIC-DT

1. Produce open and reproducible computational tools for DT design, development, and deployment that facilitate scaling of DTs and provide these tools as a freely available resource.
2. Build a multidisciplinary community of practice in digital twinning that democratises access to DT technology.

The Hub team leads and co-develop usable resources that facilitate collaborative impact and innovation that is trustworthy and responsible (e.g. knowledge commons, case studies, skills and capabilities building.
This work is undertaken alongside focused understanding and evaluation of needs and challenges faced by the TRIC-DT community (e.g. internal and external stakeholder engagement, participatory design workshops for research infrastructure).
